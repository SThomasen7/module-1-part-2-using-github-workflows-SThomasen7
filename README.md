# Scott Andersen - ATMS 523 - Hw 1 - Part 2

This fork holds my submission to Hw 1 Part 2 in ATMS 523 2025.

Usage:

execute src/maze.py with python3.
You can clone the repository, and make this executable and run the script
directly as long as you have python3 installed.

This will generate a maze you can navigate. Use

WASD to move, or HJKL to move like VIM motions. Reach the end of the maze
to finish, or hit 'Q' to quit.

**

The maze is generated using a randomized depth first search algorithm
as detailed in Wikipedia: 

Third party code was used for the getch method to improve user import, exerpience.
Adapted from stack overflow: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/510357/how-to-read-a-single-character-from-the-user

AI occasionally helped answering questions like 'how to highlight text red in the terminal'
but did not generate the code in this assignment.
